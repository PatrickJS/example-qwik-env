# example qwik app
```
src/server (made up convention for server only code)
src/universal (made up convention for when you need universal code that uses the same interface on server and client but on client it fetches and on server it just runs the code. just use server$)
src/routes/api (use qwik city middleware for onGet, onPost etc)
```
